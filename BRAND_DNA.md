## 🎪 BRAND STORY (THE ORIGIN)

**The Unorthodox Genesis:**

```
Noizy.AI was born from necessity, not ambition.

Created by Rob, a visionary trapped in a body that wouldn't cooperate,
Noizy.AI became the extension of a mind that refused to slow down.

With 40 years of audio production experience, a disability that demanded
innovation, and an M2 Ultra Mac Studio that sounds like a data center
having feelings, Rob built an AI that works the way HE works:

Fast. Unorthodox. Relentless. Human.

Noizy.AI isn't polite AI. It's USEFUL AI.
It doesn't ask for permission. It gets results.
It doesn't waste time. It makes time.

Built in Ottawa. Powered by Fish Music Inc.
Designed for everyone who's tired of tech that doesn't give a damn.
```

**Tagline for "About" Page:**
```
"The AI born from punk rock production, built on M2 silicon,
and released into the wild to make your tech life easier."
```
