# 2NDLIFE STARTER
## How to Prep Your Old Music for a Second Life

---

IF YOU'RE NOT READY TO MOVE FORWARD YET,
HERE'S HOW TO GET YOUR OLD MUSIC READY FOR A FUTURE "2NDLIFE" SESSION:

---

### 1) FIND YOUR "GRAVEYARD FOLDER"

- Pick ONE folder that holds your old tracks.
- Don't organize everything. Just identify the main pile.

---

### 2) PICK YOUR TOP 3

- Choose 3 songs that still mean something to you.
- Name them clearly: `SongTitle_YEAR_v1` / `v2` / etc.

---

### 3) EXPORT LISTENABLE VERSIONS

- If you can, bounce each song as a WAV or high-quality file.
- Keep them in one folder called `2NDLIFE_CANDIDATES`.

---

### 4) WRITE ONE SENTENCE PER SONG

For each track, answer:
- **"WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS TRACK:"**
- **"WHAT DRIVES ME CRAZY ABOUT THIS TRACK:"**

Keep it honest and short.

---

### 5) BACKUP THAT FOLDER

- Put the `2NDLIFE_CANDIDATES` folder somewhere safe (second drive or cloud).
- Future you will thank you.

---

## WHEN YOU'RE READY

THAT FOLDER IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED TO START A:
- **"QUICK RESURRECTION"** (1–2 tracks refreshed)
- **"CATALOG REVIVAL"** (full EP/album rebuilt)

---

**OLD SOUND. NEW LIFE. SAME SOUL.**
