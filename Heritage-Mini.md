# HERITAGE STARTER
## How to Begin Capturing a Voice You Love

---

EVEN IF WE NEVER WORK TOGETHER,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO MISS YOUR CHANCE TO CAPTURE A VOICE YOU LOVE.

HERE'S A SIMPLE DIY HERITAGE STARTER:

---

### 1) PICK ONE PERSON

- A parent, grandparent, elder, or anyone whose voice you'd miss.

---

### 2) CHOOSE A QUIET MOMENT

- No big speech.
- Just a calm afternoon, walk, or coffee chat.

---

### 3) USE WHATEVER YOU HAVE

- Your phone's voice recorder is enough.
- Name the file: `Name_Date_Story1`

---

### 4) ASK JUST THREE QUESTIONS

1. **"WHAT'S A MEMORY THAT STILL MAKES YOU SMILE?"**

2. **"WHAT WAS A HARD TIME YOU GOT THROUGH, AND HOW?"**

3. **"WHAT DO YOU HOPE OUR FAMILY REMEMBERS ABOUT YOU?"**

---

### 5) BACKUP THE RECORDING TWICE

- Once to a second device/drive.
- Once to a cloud service.
- Label them clearly.

---

## WHEN YOU'RE READY

IF YOU LIKE HOW THAT FEELS AND WANT TO GO DEEPER,

A FULL **"HERITAGE SESSION"** WITH ME MEANS:
- A guided conversation
- Better audio quality
- A simple transcript

So future generations can both **hear** and **read** their voice.

---

**VOICES FADE. RECORDINGS DON'T. CAPTURE THEM NOW.**
