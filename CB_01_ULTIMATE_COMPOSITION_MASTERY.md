# PART 3: SOUND DESIGN ALCHEMY

## 🔊 SYNTHESIS FROM SCRATCH

### SUBTRACTIVE SYNTHESIS

```
OSCILLATOR → FILTER → AMPLIFIER → OUTPUT
     ↑          ↑          ↑
    LFO       ENV        ENV
```

**Oscillator Waves:**
- **Saw**: Bright, buzzy, brass-like
- **Square**: Hollow, woody, clarinet-like
- **Pulse**: Width changes timbre
- **Triangle**: Soft, flute-like
- **Sine**: Pure, sub bass

**Filter Types:**
- **Low-pass**: Removes highs (most common)
- **High-pass**: Removes lows
- **Band-pass**: Removes both extremes
- **Notch**: Removes specific frequency

### FM SYNTHESIS

```
MODULATOR → CARRIER → OUTPUT
```

- Carrier = what you hear
- Modulator = changes carrier's timbre
- Ratio = harmonic relationship
- Low ratios = harmonic
- High/odd ratios = inharmonic/metallic

### WAVETABLE SYNTHESIS

- Scan through different waveshapes
- Morph between timbres
- Movement and evolution
- Modern EDM standard

### GRANULAR SYNTHESIS

- Chop audio into tiny grains
- Rearrange, stretch, pitch
- Texture, atmosphere, pads
- Time-stretching without pitch change

### ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS

- Build sound from sine waves
- Each harmonic controlled
- Resynthesis of acoustic sounds
- Organ-like tones

4. Distortion for edge
5. Delay for rhythm
6. Reverb for space

### RISERS

1. White noise
2. High-pass filter
3. Automate cutoff up
4. Add pitch rise
5. Reverb with rising decay
6. Layer with synth sweep

### IMPACTS

1. Layer: kick, explosion, sub drop
2. Reverse reverb
3. Heavy compression

3. **SPACE IS A SOUND**
   - What you don't play matters
   - Silence creates anticipation
   - Less is more

4. **STEAL LIKE AN ARTIST**
   - All artists borrow
   - Transform, don't copy
   - Your unique combination is original

5. **FINISH EVERYTHING**
   - A finished song beats 100 loops
   - Done is better than perfect
   - Learn by completing

6. **TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS**
   - First idea often best
   - Overthinking kills magic
   - If it feels right, it is right

7. **SERVE THE SONG**
   - Ego aside
   - Best part might be simplest
   - Every element earns its place

8. **EMBRACE ACCIDENTS**
   - Mistakes become discoveries
   - Wrong notes find right context
   - Happy accidents are gifts

9. **ITERATE RELENTLESSLY**
   - First draft is never final
   - Refine, polish, improve
   - Small changes compound

10. **LOVE THE PROCESS**
    - Joy in creation, not just result
    - Every session is practice
    - Music is the reward
