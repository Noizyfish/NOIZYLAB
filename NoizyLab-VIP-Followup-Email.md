**Subject:** Keeping your computer calm (VIP Care option)

---

Hi [Name],

Thanks again for having me work on your system recently.

Right now, your computer is in a much calmer, healthier state than when we started:
- [1–2 bullets: what you fixed/improved]

The thing I see all the time is that, after a few months, junk, updates, and small issues slowly creep back in until it's "emergency time" again.

To avoid that, I offer a **Calm Tech VIP Care Plan**.

In simple terms, it includes:
- Regular checkups (monthly or quarterly)
- Backup peace of mind (making sure it actually works)
- Light safety/update review
- Priority support when anything feels off

It's designed so your computer stays boringly reliable in the background while you focus on your life and work.

If you'd like, I can:
- Recommend a plan (monthly vs quarterly), and
- Send over pricing and next steps.

No pressure at all – I just want you to know this option exists if you prefer predictability over surprise breakdowns.

Best,
Rob
