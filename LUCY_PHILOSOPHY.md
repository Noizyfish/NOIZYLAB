# 🎙️ Lucy - Minimal & Topical Navigator

## TL;DR

Lucy is **not a chatty AI**. She's a calm **navigator** who says relevant things at the right time - not a constant stream of info.

---

## How to Use Lucy

### Start her
```bash
lucy-start
# Lucy: "I'm here. What do you need?"
```

### Ask questions
```bash
lucy-ask "How do I optimize this code?"
# Lucy explains naturally
```

### Check file info
```bash
lucy-read-changes src/main.py
# Lucy: "main.py. 145 lines."
```

### Adjust her pace
```bash
lucy-set-speed 0.9
```

## What Makes Lucy Different

### ❌ NOT Machine-Gun Info
- No narrating every keystroke
- No overwhelming detail
- No interrupting your flow

### ✅ Smart & Topical
- Speaks only when relevant
- Gives you what you need
- Stays out of the way

### 💡 Like a Real Colleague
- Helpful when asked
- Quiet when not needed
- Expert when you need expertise

## Lucy's Mode

**Minimal Mode (Active)**
- Only speaks about significant changes
- Only answers your questions
- Otherwise: quiet and observant

---

## The Philosophy

You control the conversation.

Lucy doesn't talk constantly. She's there when you need her. She gives you **topical information** - just what matters right now - like a navigator giving you directions when you need them, not describing the entire map.

---

## Ready to Use

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc:
source /Volumes/RSP/NOISYLABZ/.config/lucy.zsh

# Then:
lucy-start
lucy-ask "What can you help with?"
```

That's it.
