## IG POST 1 – SIGNATURE CREED INTRO

**Image:** Simple graphic of your quote, or a moody abstract image.

**Caption:**

```
ALL THE VIVID COLOURS AND ALL SUCH BEAUTY, SWIMMING AROUND IN MY HEAD… JUST WAITING TO STEP FORWARD INTO THE LIGHT AND HAVE THEIR MOMENT.
– RSP, NOIZYLAB

That's pretty much what it feels like inside my head.
NoizyLab is how I let those colours out into the world:
– CALM TECH (making computers boringly reliable)
– SECOND-LIFE SOUND (giving old music a 2NDLIFE)
– HERITAGE (capturing voices before they vanish)

If you're reading this and thinking:
"MY COMPUTER IS STRESSING ME OUT,"
"MY OLD MUSIC DESERVES BETTER," or
"I WANT TO SAVE MY FAMILY'S VOICES,"

you're exactly who I'm building this for.

Drop a 👋 and tell me which one is you.

## IG POST 2 – CALM TECH CASE FILE

**Image:** Screenshot of a messy desktop vs cleaned desktop (blur any private info).

**Caption:**

```
CASE FILE: THE PANIC MAC

Client: freelance designer.
Symptom: constant beachball, zero backup, "if this dies, I'm done."

What I did (NoizyLab Calm Tech Reset):
– Ran a full health + storage check
– Cleared years of junk & startup noise
– Set up safe updates
– Turned backups from "I hope" into "it's happening"

Result:
– Faster boot
– Quieter, predictable behavior
– "I don't think about my computer anymore. It just works."

Your computer doesn't have to be dramatic to be powerful.
If your machine is stressing you out, that's a Calm Tech job.

Comment "CALM TECH" if you want me to look at your setup.
```

## IG POST 3 – 2NDLIFE STORY

**Image:** Waveform or project screenshot, or a photo of a hard drive / old CD.

**Caption:**

```
SOME OF YOUR BEST IDEAS ARE SITTING ON OLD DRIVES.

I just did a 2NDLIFE pass on an old EP from years ago.
Thin, quiet mixes. Ideas were strong, sonics weren't.

After:
– Proper loudness
– Modern tone
– Consistent feel across the whole project

My favorite part?
The band said: "IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ALWAYS HOPED IT WOULD."

That's what 2NDLIFE is for:
OLD SOUND. NEW LIFE. SAME SOUL.

If you've got a folder of "almosts" from the past,
comment "2NDLIFE" and I'll tell you what I'd do first.
```

## IG POST 4 – HERITAGE EMOTIONAL HIT

**Image:** Something soft/emotional—hands, an old photo (no faces if you want privacy).

**Caption:**

```
WE RECORDED A GRANDMOTHER RECENTLY.

Nothing fancy. Just a relaxed conversation, a few guiding questions,
and her voice filling the room.

We caught:
– Her laugh
– The way she said everyone's names
– The pauses when she went back in time

When the family heard the recording, they went very, very quiet.
Then came the tears, and the "thank you."

VOICES FADE. RECORDINGS DON'T.
If there's someone in your life you'd hate to lose the sound of,
Heritage exists so you don't have to.

DM me "HERITAGE" if this hits a nerve.
```

## IG POST 5 – FUTURE ROB / ACCESSIBILITY

**Image:** Shot of your workspace, gear, or even just your hands and a keyboard.

**Caption:**

```
MY BODY HAS LIMITS. MY IMAGINATION DOESN'T.

A neck injury forced me to design systems that respect my energy and my hands.
I had to make computers work for me, not drain me.

That's part of what NoizyLab is:
– CALM TECH that doesn't exhaust you
– Workflows that reduce clicks and decisions
– Audio & projects organized so your brain can breathe

I FIX TODAY WITH IDEAS FROM TOMORROW,
BUT THEY ALL HAVE TO WORK INSIDE REAL HUMAN BODIES.

If your tech setup feels heavier than it should,
you're not "bad with computers."
You just don't have the right system yet.

## X POST 1 – CREED

```
ALL THE VIVID COLOURS AND ALL SUCH BEAUTY, SWIMMING AROUND IN MY HEAD… JUST WAITING TO STEP FORWARD INTO THE LIGHT AND HAVE THEIR MOMENT.
– RSP, NOIZYLAB

NOIZYLAB IS WHERE I LET THEM OUT:
– CALM TECH
– SECOND-LIFE SOUND
– HERITAGE VOICES
```

---

## X POST 2 – CALM TECH

```
YOUR COMPUTER SHOULDN'T FEEL LIKE A TICKING TIME BOMB.

A CALM TECH RESET =
– HEALTH CHECK
– DEEP CLEAN
– SAFE UPDATES
– REAL BACKUPS
– HUMAN-LANGUAGE REPORT

"BORINGLY RELIABLE" IS THE GOAL.
```

## X POST 3 – 2NDLIFE

```
I THINK HALF OF THE BEST MUSIC ON EARTH IS TRAPPED IN OLD DRIVES AND BAD MIXES.

2NDLIFE IS MY WAY OF FIXING THAT:
OLD SOUND. NEW LIFE. SAME SOUL.
```

---

## X POST 4 – HERITAGE

```
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT HOW FAST VOICES DISAPPEAR.

HERITAGE SESSIONS ARE BASICALLY:
"LET'S CAPTURE THIS PERSON'S VOICE PROPERLY WHILE WE STILL CAN."

VOICES FADE. RECORDINGS DON'T.
CAPTURE THEM NOW.
```

---

## X POST 5 – YOUR BRAIN AS PRODUCT

```
IF IDEAS ARE THE NEW COMMERCE, THEN I AM RICH BEYOND BELIEF.

MY JOB NOW IS SIMPLE:
TURN THE BEST ONES INTO
– CALM CASH
– CALM TECH
– SECOND LIVES FOR GOOD WORK.
```
