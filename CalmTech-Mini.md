# CALM TECH MINI CHECKLIST
## 5 Things to Calm Your Computer

---

HERE ARE 5 SIMPLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO CALM YOUR COMPUTER A LITTLE,
EVEN IF WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER (YET):

---

### 1) CLEAN YOUR DESKTOP

- Create ONE folder called "Desktop Dump".
- Drag EVERYTHING on your desktop into it.
- Your brain will feel better instantly.

---

### 2) CHECK YOUR STORAGE

- Aim for at least 15–20% free space.
- If you're under that, move big files (video, audio, installers) to an external drive.

---

### 3) TAME STARTUP APPS

- Turn off anything that launches at startup that you don't use daily.
- Less stuff waking up = less drama.

---

### 4) UPDATE WITH INTENTION

- Update your browser and main apps first.
- Only update the OS when you have time + a backup.

---

### 5) BACKUP SOMETHING TODAY

- Even if it's just your most important folder to an external drive or cloud.
- ONE backup is better than NONE.
